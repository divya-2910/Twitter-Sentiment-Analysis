# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using Twitter data, aiming to classify tweets as positive or negative. The pipeline involves preprocessing the text data, exploratory data analysis, creating feature representations using TF-IDF, and training a machine learning model, specifically XGBoost, for sentiment classification.
Formally, given a dataset of tweets, where label of '1' indicates the tweet is racist/sexist and label of ‘0’ indicates the tweet is not racist/sexist, the objective is to predict the labels on the given test dataset.

## Features

- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transform raw text data into numerical features using the TF-IDF technique.
- **XGBoost Model:** Implement a powerful gradient boosting algorithm for sentiment classification.
- **Decision Trees Model:** Employ a decision tree-based model for sentiment analysis.
- **Logistic Regression Model:** Utilize logistic regression for binary classification of sentiments.
